## Overview 

I was inspired to make this page in React as some good practice at taking a static sketch file and making it into a webpage.

I struggle sometimes coming up with practice side projects that also look good. I like the Youtube series Refactoring UI and I've learned a lot from watching their videos so I decided to use one of their projects as practice.

The page is made in React.js. The main focus of this page was to use consistent BEM CSS naming conventions in combination with React components. As a result, all the form does is alert the submitted email.
